# Rent Receipt Generator

This web application facilitates quick and easy generation of rent payment receipts in PDF format. It was also developed as a practical project to learn Pythonâ€™s FastAPI framework, as well as use tailwind css. I pretty much just plan on keeping this running on my home network. But others find it and decide its useful that's cool.
